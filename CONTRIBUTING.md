## Pull Requests & Code Reviews
Pull requests should never be merged by the individual who made the request.  Another member of the team should review the request and let the requestor know if any changes need to be made.  Once the changes are made, or if no changes were needed, the individual who reviewed the request can then merge it and alert the other team members.
